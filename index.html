A few classes to update skills (down the line/run: was based on [*A prio and also <i>Web2.0</i> CMS's, POST <b>awareness of Web3.0</b> basics: call ext.<i> .js</i> using reference www.w3.schools.com/ & <b>mdn</b> Web docs].</p>
        <p>If you have an <b>IDEA</b> for your website or a simple design, and you choose to present it to me, then I could and we shall see what can be done to build it.</p>
        <p> Given that your choice is to put your trust in my time'n'effort. Then I can take some time, using my skills I am able to see [w/ aid of <b>AI</b>], how much codeable it is--to get the content shown as well as its dynamic(s). <b>All that can be run online!</b></p>

        <p> Above PROJECTS [see ICONs] allow You to take a glimpse of, briefly presented, projects. I was able to gather these (and such in them I can consider having grasped the basics of coding. It is common sense and by default that ideally the <b>idea</b> would become based on 'No-Need to Reinvent the Wheel'. As sometimes,  w/'classes to tap in' JavaScript or other underlying Web-page's code, these solutions can seemingly do simple things like formatting textual presentation as well as drawing shapes of different color on the browser's screen).<br />
            Clicking on each [ICON (as these Sub-Pg's are <u>NOT Complete</u>, not yet!)] should open CODE content in browser tab.<br />
