    <p>Do u know that feeling of 'Lost in space'? [my] Experiences had started, since Dec-24, when I sat on my desk and got engaged into Codecademy learning--its skillpaths (focused to topics: <b>Cybersecurity</b> and <b>Front End development</b>).<br> 
       So this experience is a return of an 'old-school Coder' having had diven into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coursework of Codecademy<br>
    W/ loads of enthousiasm and passion for coding in JavaScript as well as learning the next sequel of 'Web Dev' related coding..</p>
    <p>In my deep dark past [if u can call it that], I once had begun coding with 'UCSD Pascal'. In my university years, I had crunched numerical data from database and had compiled sources of programming code. Specific product from the past is Borland dBaseIV together with its SQL component to perform SELECT FROM... SQL-queries. My passion has been to aggregate data (from a db's numeric attribute data-fields). In the course of time, I had advanced in programming, by coding and had compiled code in C language (it was two C programming courses completed, as part of the curriculum). At the end of the 90's, I had built a 'Hello world' web-page by plain using <b>html</b>. Out of curiosity (and as plain fun), I had the habit to study open source software projects. Once I found a project and found its 'repo', I attempted to compile the source code in RedHat (linux), i.e. Alsa-project for getting sound included as a kernel module and I had discovered more: the good old Winamp software could be ported to linux [from its source, so able to play music of formats mp3 and .flac from a Linux distro (at the time that distro in the distrivution was v.5.2/6.x]</p><br>
    <p>Well, that's it.., for now... I could join a 'Web Dev' coding collaboration, if we set the target [**and tech-chall. is not that much of a 'wrangling' on the server-side]. And, in any scenario it's subject to anticipated free slots* [*in each-one's cal's]</p>
