    <p>Do u know that feeling of 'Lost in space'? [my] Experiences had started, since Dec-24, when I sat on my desk and got engaged into Codecademy learning--its skillpaths (focused to topics: <b>Cybersecurity</b> and <b>Front End development</b>).<br> 
       So this experience is a return of an 'old-school Coder' having had diven into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coursework of Codecademy<br>
    W/ loads of enthousiasm and passion for coding in JavaScript as well as learning the next sequel of 'Web Dev' related coding..</p>
    <p>In my deep dark past [if u can call it that], I once had begun coding with 'UCSD Pascal'. In my university years, I had Borland dBaseIV together with its SQL component to perform SELECT FROM... SQL-queries to produce aggregate data (from a db's numeric attribute data-field), and had advanced in programming, by coding and had compiled code in C language (it was in two courses that were part of the curriculum). Besides, I had built a 'Hello world' web-page plainly using <b>html</b>. And, for the heck of it (as plain fun), I had compiled source code in RHEL (linux), i.e. alsa-project for getting sound included as a kernel module and had discovered source code of the good old Winamp ported to linux (so was able to play music in RHEL v.5.0/6.x).</p><br>
    <p>Well, I wont elaborate any more detail (I could hook up w/ coding collaboration, if the target set and technical challenge is not that much of a 'wrangling' on the server-side). And, it is anyhow subject to anticipated free slots in each-one's calendar.</p>
