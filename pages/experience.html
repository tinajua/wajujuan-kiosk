    <p>Do u know that feeling of 'Lost in space'? [my Experiences had started  since Dec-24 when I got on desk and hooked to Codecademy learning its skillpaths for Front End development online).<br> So this experience is a return of the 'old-school Coder' having diven into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coursework thru Codecademy<br>
    W/ loads of enthousiasm and passion for coding in JavaScript as well as learning the next sequel of 'Web Dev' related coding... in deep dark past I had built with html and also done compiling source code in linux.</p><br><p>Well, I wont elaborate any more detail (I could hook up w/ coding collaboration, if the target set and technical challenge is not that much of a 'wrangling' on the server-side). And, it is anyhow subject to anticipated free slots in each-one's calendar.</p>
