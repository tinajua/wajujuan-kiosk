    <p>Do u know that feeling of 'Lost in space'? [my Experiences had started, since Dec-24, when I sat on my desk and got engaged into Codecademy learning--its skillpaths (focused to topics: Cybersecurity and Front End development).<br> 
       So this experience is a return of an 'old-school Coder' having had diven into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coursework of Codecademy<br>
    W/ loads of enthousiasm and passion for coding in JavaScript as well as learning the next sequel of 'Web Dev' related coding.. In my deep dark past [if u can call it that], I once had begun coding with 'UCSD Pascal'. In my university years, I compiled code with C language (two courses were part of the studies). Besides, I had built plainly with html and also done compiling some source code in RHEL (linux).</p><br><p>Well, I wont elaborate any more detail (I could hook up w/ coding collaboration, if the target set and technical challenge is not that much of a 'wrangling' on the server-side). And, it is anyhow subject to anticipated free slots in each-one's calendar.</p>
