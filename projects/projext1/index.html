    <h1>Project 1: My Cool Preparation for Development, incl. IMG Processing [mainly w/] 'Krita'<b>*</b></h1>
    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">
      <h2>Strategy & the Main Tasks</h2><h3>These are Done [from ToDo's common to ad hoc development]:</h3>
    </div>
     <p><b>To enhance</b>, <b>resize</b> (image dimesion: 300x200px is a recommendation should there be many: eg. +7 images [type: IMG-like-'ICON'-] as a grid of images).
       <br>For the purpose of <b>displaying</b> elements in a Flexbox (they get placed in a layout of a 'stylesheet').
       <br>Strategy: maximum compression chosen as method to save load time. Plus separation into project pages (for keeping topics of projects separated).</p>
     <p>For visual enhancement, provision of [IMG's] for each Project content makes items like 'Menu' to look COOL as such [even if it is static by its code content]! The case in point is a static page, enhanced by CSS's 'hover over' to create user intuition and ICONs keep a web-pg reader curious to click for project content. Usability keeps quick on static pages, if based on Github, i.e. known to load static-[IMGs]-quickly. This keeps the user experience good and keeps experience of the web-page's as responsive and attractive.</p>
     <p>i.e. Bringing functionality by means of above means as the  basic strategy is true, should web-pg's landing page be designed taking into account these considerations. Any Web-page and its content may eventually grow. Pages may render as structured layouts combining text and images. As with standard documentation, semantic elements like headings, paragraphs, and labeled figures enhance clarity and contextual relevance when visual content is present.</p>
     <p class="final">In terms of actual Pg-development environment ('set of tools'): Local coding is made possible setting up .nvm for Node and http-server or Express.<br>
       A better environment obtained w/VS code (facility to code'n'build HTML or other code), the MS's code editor. There are alternative editors that can be used

       <p class="justified-wide">eg. by means of <b>Krita*</b>, an Open Source software maintained by its community, it's a FREE app for the purpose of IMG-processing
     ** you might opt to developing of images with it, and for a deeper understanding of eg. 'background removal from images'.

     <p class="footnote">*** A Strategy Option worth a mention: 'LazyLoading' or however external loads can be managed [retrieved from extrernal source] should it solve tech constraints by gains in the usability; so this is an alt. method (these topics not covered in this project)</p>

<!-- In this "Projext1" Exercise, the lesson learnt was about CSS: the very basics of textual style formatting in html is provided --> 
<!-- Use of <p>-tag each coded as: <p class="final"> so THEN custom.css has this part of text-size reduce to 0.85em ; Value 0.65em makes it as small as <h6> Heading-tag--> 
<!-- Hence, it can be determined that Heading tag <h5> would have this default Font's size when it is reduces to the said 0.85em -->
