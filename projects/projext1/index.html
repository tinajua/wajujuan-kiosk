    <h1>Project 1: My 1st Cool Preparation for Development, incl. Image Processing [mainly w/] 'Krita'<b>*</b></h1>
    <p><h2>Strategy & the Main Tasks</h2><h3>These are Done [from ToDo's common to ad hoc development]:</h3>
          <p><b>To enhance</b>, <b>resize</b> (image dimesion: 300x200px is a recommendation should there be many: eg. +7 images [type: IMG-ICON] as a grid of images).
       <br>For the purpose of <b>displaying</b> elements in a Flexbox (they get placed in a layout of a 'stylesheet').
       <br>Strategy: maximum compression chosen as method to save load time. Plus separation into project pages (for keeping topics of projects separated).</p>
    <p>For visual enhancement, provision of [IMG's] for each Project content makes items like 'Menu' to look COOL as such [even if it is static by its code content]! The case in point is a static page, enhanced by CSS's 'hover over' to create user intuition and ICONs keep a web-pg reader curious to click for project content. Usability keeps quick on static pages, if based on Github, i.e. known to load static-[IMGs]-quickly. This keeps the user experience good and keeps experience of the web-page's as responsive and attractive.</p>
    <p>i.e. Bringing functionality by means of above means as the  basic strategy is true, should web-pg's landing page be designed taking into account these considerations. Any Web-page and its content may eventually grow. However, the Pg's may build into readable layout of text and images (that all display when loaded). Just like any publication headings and paragraphs are necessary as well as labelling of 'Figs', i.e.Figures' (for the readability, if any Fig's, together w/textual content, are presented).</p>
    <p class="final">In terms of actual Pg-development environment ('set of tools'): Local coding is made possible setting up .nvm for Node and http-server or Express.<br>
       A better environment obtained w/VS code (facility to code'n'build HTML or other code), the MS's code editor. There are alternative editors that can be used
       <b>'to avoid telemetry'</b> [*this's a hyped up topic in modern day use of sw-products & browsers]</p>
       <b>* Krita</b> is an Open Source software maintained by its community, it's a FREE app for the purpose of graphical image processing
     <br>** should you have reason to trust developing of images with it..., for a deeper understanding of eg. 'background removal from images'. 
     <br>Even if there's automated on-line facility to do just that. For more artistic purposes, find more info in its forum about Krita (as a creativity tool) from 'Krita Artista' organisation, for more information see <a HREF="https://krita-artists.org">krita-artists.org</p>

    <p class="final">*** A Strategy Option worth a mention: 'LazyLoading', or however external loads can be managed [retrieved from extrernal source] should it solve tech constraints by gains in the usability; so this is an alt. method (these topics notcovered in this project)</p>

<!-- In this "Projext1" Exercise, the lesson learnt was about CSS: the very basics of textual style formatting in html is provided --> 
<!-- And, use of <p>-tag to which coded as: <p class="final"> so then its custom.css has this part of text-size reduce to 0.85em ; Value 0.65em makes it as small as <h6> Heading-tag--> 
<!-- Hence, it can be determined that Heading tag <h5> would have this default Font's size when it is reduces to the said 0.85em -->
