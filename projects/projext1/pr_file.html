    <h1>Basically: there are many requirements to code and publish (together w/security considerations)</h1>
    <p>I chose to take Codecamy's skillpath lessons of core fuctionality provided by JavaScript(JS): the lessins proceeds
       through basics of writing code for the purpose of publishing it on web.page content. 
    <p>JS code can be called from the code sent to a browser and is based on web services. A web-sites inial landing page can call and at best keeps JS code simple on that page.<br>
       If development harnesses Front End development technology to be published fron sub pages of the site,
       this reuires learning coding in the introduction to <b>node.js</b> and how it can be set up locally. So beside<br>
       <b>Node</b>, for instance local coding is made possible by Node. It involves setting up <b>.nvm</b> which is a local environment designed for the development purpose.<br>
       On the other hand, in this environment, this tool is called VS code (to facilitate building HTML sites or locally functioning code with fuctionlities from its plug-ins available). Very commonly used tool is VS code, core component from wihch a developer accesses it as a tool, is  a code editor. There are alternative and equivalent products
       available, if needed to avoid telemetry collected by producer of VS code.</p>
