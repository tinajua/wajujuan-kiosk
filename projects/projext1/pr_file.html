    <h1>The Grand Idea
    <p>There are many requirements initiating development: 1st to sketch an idea/design, to code it and to publish a web-site (as well as steps taken for the most crucial w/security level as considered).</p>
    <p>In Codecamy's skillpath lessons (my choice) the core fuctionality is provided by JavaScript(JS): the lessons proceed</p>
       through the basics of writing JS-code, also for its purpose to bring about functionality to a published web-page. 
    <p>JS-code can get called from the code 1st read into a browser. Interpreting of code files is based on 'stacks' (eg. NGINX) built on top of the web services. The initial landing page a browser opens, typically index.html and this is where the call get read. HTML code that calls JS code is simple (1-line of code).<br>If the development harnesses multiple Front End development technology to be published from sub pages of web-page site, then<br>this requires learning coding in the introduction to <b>node.js</b> and how it can be set up locally. 
    <p>So beside <b>Node</b>, for instance, local test enviroment is made possible by Node. It involves setting up <b>.nvm</b>, a local environment designed for this development purpose.</p>>
    <p>On the other hand, in this environment, another tool is called VS code (a mode visually appealing facility for codeing and building HTML sites (or even locally functioning code with fuctionalities from its plug-ins available).</p> 
    <p>Very commonly used tool is VS code, core component from which a developer accesses all code-files. It is a visually appealing code editor. However, there are alternative and equivalent development tool products
       available, if needed, to avoid telemetry collected by the producer of VS code.</p>
