    <h1>Project 5: UI Workflow in certain scenarios (apart from the norm) and <b>its visuals</b></h1>
    <p>Where to start Your productivity? You need to figure our a strategy. Normally adapting to a typical 'Work Out' as by the app You're using</p>
    <p>Apart from the norm of scenarios You might encounter, at creative stage, as a basis for web-page to contain images, and you've been preparing them from 'ground up' (i.e. right after getting img's prepared). Scenario(1): actual <i>Copying of Files to</i> Project's <b>dir</b> [App You've been using, Paint.NET/Gimp/Krita/ to edit img-file, and it has the img-file stored in <b>PC's dir</b> or Cloud (i.e. from online source may require to Dwnld&Save it as 'local file') ].</p> 
    <div class="text-section">
    <ul><li>In this scenario: move the file from locally stored w/command applied in terminal.</li>
    <li> There is a command (available in unix/Linux): <b>mv</b> [filename] [to-a-folder's <b>dir</b>-path].</li> 
    <li>In Linux: moves & renames that img-file (both at-the-same-time).</li>
    </ul></div> 
       <p>And, using <b>mv</b> command is practical in such ToDo's that are completely outside of the Web Browser environment. What alternative scenarios You might come across ?</p> 
    <p>Perhaps an organisation has issued a guideline and by design your team is not allowed to reveal business secrets (to outside World). Not before the company's plan to open a flagship store and online shop--the web-pages, part of which your team implements. Once the store in the building is inaugurated, a 'Grand Opening' follows (their new system and/or service gets deployed). This development scenario: the guideline is set and You are obliged to follow official advise about how to do it. You must comply! In that you're not allowed to store img-files in any external storage facility (i.e. Cloud services).</p>
    <p>What about common typical Workflow? Below is a picture of Browser's Window-Header-Section designated to contain <b>'Your Tabs Opened'</b> (browsers to offer by default a restore option to another day's session</p>  
    <img src= '../../assets/Pro1_Foxbar.png' alt="web-browser's tabs" <b>Figure: Tabs commonly shown in Web-browser Tab1 | Tab2 | Tab3 etc."</b></img> 
    <p class="p.final">"<b>30 yrs of Linux</b>" (in 2022), and to this day Linux is gaining poularity in the market of <b>OS</b>s!</p>
