    <h1>Project 5: UI Workflow scenarios</b></h1>
    <p>From where to lauch productivity? Adapting to a typical 'Work Out' as given by app's functionlity. New trends keep emerging: one is to  set up Homar a concept of <b>Vivaldi*</b></p>
    <p>Apart from trending apps on offer. A basic scenario, is at creative stage, as a basis for web-page to contain images. Let's assume a source for images is built 'ground up' (i.e. post img preparation). Practical level (task): actual <i>Copying of Files to</i> Project's <b>dir</b> [source: your chosen app in use: Paint.NET/Gimp&Bimp/Krita/ where img-files are stored in <b>PC's dir</b> or Cloud (i.e. from online source may require to Dwnld&Save it as 'local file') ].</p> 
    <div class="text-section">
    <ul><li>In this scenario: move the file from locally stored w/command applied in terminal.</li>
    <li> There is a command (available in unix/Linux): <b>mv</b> [filename] [to-a-folder's <b>dir</b>-path].</li> 
    <li>In Linux: moves & renames that img-file (both at-the-same-time).</li>
    </ul></div> 
       <p>And, using <b>mv</b> command is practical in such ToDo's that are completely outside of the Web Browser environment.</p> 
    <p class="final">What alternative scenarios You might come across ?<br>
    Perhaps an organisation has issued a guideline and by design your team is not allowed to reveal business secrets (to outside World). Not before the company's plan to open a flagship store and online shop--the web-pages, part of which your team implements. Once the store in the building is inaugurated, a 'Grand Opening' follows (their new system and/or service gets deployed). This development scenario: the guideline is set and You are obliged to follow official advise about how to do it. You must comply! In that you're not allowed to store img-files in any external storage facility (i.e. Cloud services).</p>

    <p class="final">What about common typical Workflow? Below is a picture of Browser's Window-Header-Section designated to contain <b>'Your Tabs Opened'</b> (by default restore option gets offered to a session upon return to the browser).<br><a href="../../index.html">Back to Portfolio, <-click!</a></p>

    <p class="final">"<b>30 yrs of Linux</b>" (in 2022), and to this day Linux is gaining popularity in the market of <b>OS</b>s!</p>
    <p class="footnote"><b>*Vivaldi, pronounced:<b>v ɪ ˈ v ɑː l d i</b> was founded by Tatsuki Tomita & Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner. A freeware, cross-platform browser, w/customizable laucher and email built-in as its components.</p>
